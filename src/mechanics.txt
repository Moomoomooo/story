The basic format is turn-based combat. 

  each ability has BASE {{INITIATIVE}} score. Each entity in the fight adds their initiative value to that score, and that sum is added to an ordered list. Characters select their action (or actions) for the round before any actions are executed. Most abilities stay within the 0-100 range. If there is an initative tie, boss monsters act first, followed by the player, then regular monsters, than allies. In-group ties are resolved in an arbitrary order.
  Characters act highest-to-lowest.

Some actions have a {{SPECIAL}} initiative score. For example, maybe a {{PARRY-RIPOSTE}} skill that automatically blocks and counter's an enemy's attack. 

  However, a character's action can be {{DISRUPTED}} if they get hit by an enemy's attack(hence, going first giving you a change to disrupt attacks
and avoid being disrupted), especially if they recieve a critical hit. A character has a chance to BLOCK or DODGE. {{BLOCKING}} is safer but might 
not negate all the damage. DODGING is riskier; since you break your stance, a failed dodge automatically {{DISRUPTS}} you and makes you more 
likely to recieve a {{CRITICAL HIT}}. Still, a succcessful dodge negates all damage and effects, and a {{CRITICAL DODGE}} means you expose an 
enemy's weak point(rolling behind their back or under their belly), guarenteeing your next attack will be an {{UNAVOIDABLE}} {{CRITICAL HIT}}.

If the player is hit before they can use a consumable item, that action is automatically DISRUPTED and the item is wasted.

As the player progresses, they will recieve more actions per round. Enemies will also gain more actions per round. (the final boss {{YMIR}} will get a total of nine). Some abilities will cost more than one action, balancing power for multitude. Mostly, one action abilities are faster than multi-action ones(unless, say, the express trade-off of the ability is greater speed, like million-mile slash).



levelups are collectibles. there are 11 levelups in each region(so the max level is 100.)  10 scattered throughout the plain and one as a reward for defeating the region's final boss.


{{DIVINITY}} is a special stat. {{DIVINITY}} is increased by hanging from a {{ROPE OF REVELATION}} and completing a {{MINDSCAPE BATTLE}}. {{MINDSCAPE BATTLE}}s are special boss battles fought in the center of Niam's mind. 
1. Angel. A relatively simple boss that uses {{PHYSICAL}} and {{MAGICAL}} {{HOLY}} attacks. 
2. Archangel
3. Principality 
4. {{Power of Prophecy}}. A warrior angel, wielding {{HOLY}} and {{PHYSICAL}} attacks.
5. {{Virtue}}. 
6. Dominion
7. {{THRONES OF THE HALF-GOD}}. A pair powerul flaming wheels that wields powerful {{HOLY}} and {{FIRE}}{{SPELLS}}. 
8. {{Cherub }}. A four-faced angelic entity. Each face gets to take its own action and has its own traits. The defending face is always the one that last acted. The Lion is a mixed {{PHYSICAL}} and {{MAGICAL}} {{FIRE}} based fighter. It can also cast {{BUFF}}s its allies with its magestic presence. Its defenses are moderate, but its highly resistant to debuffs. The Ox face is a powerful but slow {{PHYSICAL}} tank with high offense and defense, and its horn attacks have especially high {{PIERCE}}. The Eagle face is a fast and agile {{PHYSICAL}} threat that can inflict high damage and {{BLEED}} but has low defenses. The human face is a {{MAGICAL}} fighter that inflicts massive damage on-hit, but is the weakest defensively.
