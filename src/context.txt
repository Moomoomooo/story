As an einherjar, Niam lacks the ability to die permanently.

Niam has the seed of the grandmother tree implanted in his left eye socket after losing his eye to Fenrir.

Niam is a lightweight fighter like his mentor, red. He wields a shortsword in one hand, leaving his other open to 

Heaven is rotting. Infected. 

$$ Act I $$

tutorial fight is Red, Niam's einherjar mentor. Red is a [PHYSICAL] and [BLEED]-based fighter. Introduces the player to basic attacks, abilities, and conditions. Based on little Red Riding hood. A blonde woman with a bright red cowl. Red fights with a pair of hatchets (woodsman reference), which trails blood-red energy around when she swings them around (the energy is a reference to the wine Red Riding Hood carries in her basket.) 


In the climax of the first act, Red saves Niam from Fenrir (the big bad wolf), giving our protagonist a chance to flee. Red's fate becomes uncertain, and won't be encountered again until act IV. 

ACT II:



$$ Act IV $$

act IV Boss: Rotting Red. Once again an agile [PHYSICAL] and [BLEED]-based fighter, but corrupted to be much more agressive and deadly. Now based on the Nuckalevee (Red Riding Hood. Like Riding a Horse, get it?) and bears an acid-scarred appearance (like half-dissolved in stomach acid). The blades of her axe have now fused to her wrists in place of her hands, which have detached and enlarged into grotesque disembodied "wings" that float behind her back. ("What big hands you have!"). A single massive inhuman eye dominates what was once her face, mirrored by two other eye embedded in each of her palms ("what big eyes you have!"). The horse-half has an enormous slavering maw. Its mane is made of human teeth. ("What big teeth you have!"). The ears of both the horse and the human body are elongated into wicked, fleshy horns. ("what big ears you have!") 
  Attacks:

$$ Act VIII $$

Act VIII boss: Surtr - the warlord King of Valquera, known for his terriying stature and mastery of {FIRE}-style {BLADE ARTS}. Surtr is best known as the one who slew the last of the Aesir and felled the Grandmother Tree, plunging the worlds into the Age of Turmoil. King Surtr wields the mighty Sword of Summer, a massive flaming greatsword fit for the one called the King of Tumult. A berserker-style fighter, he is fairly easy to hit but very hard to {{DISRUPT}}. Surtr is divinity level 7. He gets four actions per round, but usually uses 2+ action-cost skills, all of which are almost garenteed to {{disrupt}} the player on-hit. Surtr has heavy defenses. 

$$ Act IX $$


Final Boss, first stage: Fenris Wolf. A powerful infected Wolf. Invulnerable to [PHYSICAL] damage. 


Final Boss: Ymir, World's Soul. Design heavily based on Tlaltecuhtli, mesoamerican "earth monster" deity. A powerful [DIVINITY] that can wield [FIRE] (Muspelhiem), [ICE] (niflheim) attacks, while afflicing the player with his powerful illusion [SPELL]s (ginnunagap). This is based on the creation myth where the muspelhiem and niflhiem created Ymir in the Gunningagap in the original mythology. As the "earth monster", it can also deal powerful [PHYSICAL] damage and inflict heavy [BLEED] (because aztec blood sacrifices were performed to appease the earth monster).  
A parallel is drawn to cutting open the wolf's stomach? forshaow the 'true grandmother' of all things. Fenrir talks about being the "incubator" for the infection's final stage. 

Optional Boss: Jormungandr. Highly difficult [VENOM] and [PHYSICAL] based fighter. heavily resists [MAGIC] but is weak to [LIGHTNING]. Resides in [EIELA] but is definitely an endgame boss. Even dealing it [PHYSICAL] damage inflicts retaliatory [VENOM] damage. Defeating him grants [Fang of the World] weapon and [Serpent's Scale-Mail] armor items.

Reoccuring boss: Ratatoskr. Agile [PHYSICAL] fighter with a myriad of [MENTAL] [DEBUFF]s and [DRUIDIC] magic. Ratatoskr is parralled with the many foxes of fables, a cunning trickster and bringer of trouble. Intentionally annoying, designed with many "gotcha" abilities. To avoid seeming unnessesarily frustrating,, this should be foreshadowed heavily to players, encouraging them to beat the rodent at its own game. In particular, Ratatoskr is invulnerable (except to the spreading infection), which means every fight with him is an enviormental puzzle. Lore wise, Ratatoskr is an giant wooden squirrel, errant child of the Grandmother Oak. Ratatoskr serves as a transient sometime-ally throughout the story, helping and harming as he pleases. He's motivated by his fascination with [Eye of the Sower], refering to Niam as "Father-man." Ratatoskr can be fought a total of 3 times throughout the game. [RATATOSKR'S FOOTPRINTS] occassionally show up throughout the game, guiding the player to findable items... or especially dangerous areas.
